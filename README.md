# mija.cfg
deadlock config


noteworthy is that my binds are a bit different.

i have my abilities set up like this:
ability1: f14 (i rebind capslock to f14)
ability2: q
ability3: e
ability4: f

my items are on 2,3,x,c

alt = cancel cast (space is ONLY jump, not cancel)
4 = speed on zipline
mouse sidebutton = parry and melee

those are the most notable bind changes. you probably dont want them like that, just take out aliases you want instead of copying the full config.
